# Exercise: Conditional Rendering in React
In this exercise, you will practice different ways to render JSX conditionally in React components.

## Step 1: Create a Weather Component with `if`, `else if`, and `else`
1. Create a new file called `Weather.jsx`.
2. Inside this file, create a functional component called `Weather`.
3. The component should:
- Take a `temperature` prop.
- Use `if`, `else if`, and `else` statements to conditionally render different messages based on the temperature value:
  - If the temperature is below 15, display: "It's cold outside!"
  - If the temperature is between 15 and 25, display: "It's nice outside!"
  - If the temperature is above 25, display: "It's hot outside!"

## Step 2: Create a `UserStatus` Component with the `&&` Operator
1. Create a new file called `UserStatus.jsx`.
2. Inside this file, create a functional component called `UserStatus`.
3. The component should:
- Take two boolean props `loggedIn`, `isAdmin`
- Use the `&&` operator to display a message for Admin & Normal User:
  - If `loggedIn` is `true` and `isAdmin` display: "Welcome Admin!"
  - If it's just `loggedIn` and not admin then display "Welcome User".

## Step 3: Create a Greeting Component with a Ternary Operator
1. Create a new file called `Greeting.jsx`.
2. Inside this file, create a functional component called `Greeting`.
3. The component should:
- Take a timeOfDay prop (e.g., `"morning"`, `"afternoon"`, or `"evening"`).
- Use the ternary operator to conditionally display different greetings based on the time of day:
  - If `timeOfDay` is `"morning"`, display: "Good morning!"
  - If `timeOfDay` is `"afternoon"`, display: "Good afternoon!"

## Step 4: Render the Components in App.jsx
