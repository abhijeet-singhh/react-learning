# My React Learning Progress

Welcome to my **react-learning** repository! This repo is a collection of my journey as I learn React.js. It includes various exercises and projects that I've built along the way to practice and demonstrate my skills. I'm sharing this here to track my progress and to help others who might be on a similar learning path.

## Repository Structure

The repo is organized into two main folders:

### 1. `exercises`
This folder contains smaller exercises that I worked on to practice fundamental React concepts, such as:
- Components (functional & class-based)
- State and props
- Event handling
- React hooks (useState, useEffect, useRef, etc.)
- Conditional rendering
- Form handling
- Handling user input and events

These exercises helped me solidify core React concepts. They are simple and focused on specific topics, allowing me to build my understanding step by step.

### 2. `projects`
In this folder, you will find some more advanced projects I worked on to apply my knowledge of React in real-world applications. These projects have challenged me to use:
- React Router for routing and navigation
- Axios or Fetch API for HTTP requests
- Context API or Redux for state management
- Styling with Tailwind or Styled Components
- Unit testing with libraries like Jest

Some of the projects may still be a work in progress, but they represent my growth as I continue learning React.

## How to Run the Code

To get started with any exercise or project in this repo:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-learning.git
   cd react-learning
